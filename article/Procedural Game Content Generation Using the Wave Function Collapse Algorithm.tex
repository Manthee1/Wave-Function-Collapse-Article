\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

% An Introduction to the application of the wave function collapse algorithm for procedural generation of game content.
Procedural content generation (PCG) is a general term for a system that follows some patterns and generates an output based on those patterns.
Its use case is generating assets or content that would be too time-consuming to create manually.
PCG is mainly connotatively tied to game content generation, but its use cases can be more creative.
Most PCG systems use game-specific assets with game-specific rules and algorithms to generate their content.
A more general application fit for a wide range of games is the Wave Function Collapse algorithm developed by Maxim Gumin \cite{WFC}.
Wave Function Collapse is a greedy PCG algorithm based on the concept of collapsing a wave function, which is a mathematical representation of a quantum state.
This method can generate a large, high-quality, consistent output from a small set of input patterns.
It can be used in various applications, although its most commonly used for generating 2D tilemaps for games.
It can also generate 3D models, music, poetry, and more.
WFC's output can only be as good as its input, so it's essential to have a good set of input patterns and rules. 
My goal in this thesis is to create a simple, configurable application that will use the WFC algorithm to generate tilemaps for games, given a user-defined set of input patterns and rules.
